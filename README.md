# Maze Game
## Objective
<p align="justify">
The goal of this project is to develop a simple way for the user to generate a maze and solve them through the use of algorithms.
</p>

## Detail

### creating a maze
<p align="justify">
To create a maze, one has to click on the create maze button on the main screen. Afterwards, the user is led to a section where they can choose their prefered algorithm to build their maze.
To use the algorithms, the user has to specify the row and column numbers. The submit button is then pressed followed by the algorithm of choice. Lastly, clicking on generate should produce a maze with the proper dimensions.
The user can also manually click on the representation of the maze, which appears on the right side, to edit it. Mazes can also be saved on the location of your choosing.
</p>

### Solving a maze
<p align="justify">
To solve a maze, one has to click on the solve maze button on the main screen. Afterwards, the user is led to a section where a maze is already presented. to choose a different maze, one should go to "Option" located at the top third option from the left and select "select maze". 
A maze is solved by clicking tiles/buttons and making a continuous path between the "start" and "end" squares. To verify whether you have found the shortest path, it is recommended to use the "BFS" solution found under "See Solution".
